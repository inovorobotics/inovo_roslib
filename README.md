# inovo_roslib
Example roslibpy implementations for controlling the robot using rosbridge

## Usage

!!! WARNING !!!
The examples in this repository will move the robot to arbitrary positions. Always hold the e-stop when running these scripts so you can stop the robot before it crashes into anything.

Install python dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace the IP address in the scripts with the IP address of your robot.

Run the examples with:
```
./<scriptname>
```
